# How to use

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows 10 build 17063, or later (*cURL* is included)

1. Change the webhook to yours.
2. Remove the fail-safes. ("goto xxx")
3. Run the batch file.

### ‚ùå Get rid of the comments üìù
* Do a regex search on notepad++, match `^::.*\n` and replace with nothing.

### ‚õî Avoid
* Just changing the webhook and doing nothing else. 
  * If the batch file does nothing the user will open it to see what's wrong.
